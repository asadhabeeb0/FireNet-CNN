The training accuracy is a measure of how well the model performs on the data used for training, 
while the validation accuracy is a measure of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. 
When the training accuracy is high and the validation accuracy is low, it may suggest that the model 
has memorized the training data instead of learning to generalize well to new data.

In your specific example, if the accuracy is increasing while the validation accuracy is fluctuating 
between high values (such as 91) and low values (such as 75), it could suggest that the model is 
overfitting to some parts of the training data, while not generalizing well to other parts. This 
could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the model being too complex or not having enough training data.


To address this issue, you can try several techniques to reduce overfitting, such as regularization, 
early stopping, or reducing the complexity of the model. Additionally, it may be helpful to collect 
more training data or perform data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data. 
Finally, it is also important to perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure 
that the model is not overfitting to a particular subset of the data or to specific values of the 
hyperparameters.
