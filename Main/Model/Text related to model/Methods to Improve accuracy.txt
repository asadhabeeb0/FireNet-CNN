Use transfer learning: Instead of training a model from scratch, you can use a pre-trained model that has already been trained on a large dataset. You can fine-tune this pre-trained model on your specific task, which can save you a lot of training time and can improve the accuracy of your model.

Use a smaller architecture: One way to reduce the number of trainable parameters in your model is to use a smaller architecture. You can use a smaller number of layers, reduce the width of each layer, or use smaller filters in convolutional layers.

Use regularization techniques: Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping can help to prevent overfitting of the model, which can improve the generalization performance and accuracy of the model.

Use data augmentation: By using data augmentation techniques, you can artificially increase the size of your dataset and improve the robustness of your model. This can be particularly useful when the amount of available data is limited.

Use pruning: Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of a model by removing unnecessary weights and connections. This can help to reduce the number of trainable parameters in the model while maintaining or even improving its accuracy.

Use quantization: Quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations, which can help to reduce the number of trainable parameters in the model while maintaining or even improving its accuracy.

Use knowledge distillation: Knowledge distillation is a technique in which a smaller, simpler model is trained to mimic the outputs of a larger, more complex model. This can help to reduce the number of trainable parameters in the model while maintaining or even improving its accuracy.
